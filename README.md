# gophercises

A place for my solutions to exercises from Jon Calhoun's [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/). 

#### Note
At one point I wanted to experiment with how to use these packages as a consumer, which is why some are structured oddly, with a `main.go` along with another file with some public functions and methods that was meant to be its own package. Moved them into the same (main) package for organizational purposes.
